# Fig. 3: Epidemic dynamics differ depending on the intervention

This folder contains the code for reproducing Fig. 3 of the paper. The files are as follows:

- `plot_fig3.py` -- the script file that generates the figure.
- `run_fig3a.py` -- run the simulations for the transmission trees.
- `run_fig3b.py` -- run the simulations for the theoretical explorations.
- `fig3_transtrees.obj` -- the cached transmission trees (output of `run_fig3a.py`).
- `fig3.sims` -- the cached simulations (output of `run_fig3b.py`).

# Outputs

This folder contains the calibrated parameter sets that are the output of `fig1_calibration/run_optimization.py`, and are then used in other analyses:

- `opt_merged_sep20_sg0.json` -- calibrated parameter values via Optuna, merged across multiple runs, from 2020-Sep-20, without SafeGraph.
- `opt_merged_sep20_sg1.json` -- as above, except using SafeGraph data.

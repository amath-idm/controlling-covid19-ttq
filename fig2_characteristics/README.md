# Fig. 2: Modeled transmission dynamics

This folder contains the code for reproducing Fig. 2 of the paper. The files are as follows:

- `fig2_plot.py` -- the script file that generates the figure.
- `cache_populations.py` -- generates the populations used by `create_sim.py`.
- `create_sim.py` -- configures the simulation for `run_fig2.py`.
- `run_fig2.py` -- uses the calibrated model to run the simulations.
- `fig2_sep25.sim` -- the cached simulation (output of `run_fig2.py`).
